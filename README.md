# Tinu
**Tinu** is a cost effective air quality monitoring system used to collect data for a research project sponsered by NYIT for Kevin Mauricio Leal.

# Research Plan

***Rationale***

  Children are exposed to poor indoor air qualities in nursery and primary schools (Branco
et al, 2019). This can cause children to be exposed to particulate matter (PM). Air pollution was
reported the cause of death of 5.5 million people and left 141.5 million people disabled in 188
countries from 1990 to 2013 (Forouzanfar et al., 2015). NOx, CO, and SO2 are principal
contributors of PM to the environment. (Yadav et al. 2019.)

  My research project is to understand just how much PM school children get on average
from school 7 hours a day for 5 days a week. From understanding approximately how much PM
and what that PM is made up of, steps can be taken to better ensure the air quality is healthy for
the students and staff. Data that is collected can be used to create reforms in the way schools and
other places are made to keep up with air quality codes especially in times of COVID-19.

***Research Questions***

1. What kind of matter makes up the PM that is measured?
2. Does the location of the school effect the matter that makes up PM?
3. Approximately how much PM does one student breathe in throughout the school year

***Procedures***

  The Sensor Unit – The sensor unit will be made using a Raspberry Pi 4 board, containing
various sensors like CO2, mass air flow, humidity, temperature, nitrogen, etc. a user interface
will also be integrated to allow easy viewing and exporting to data management systems. All
cased in a cover similar of that to a smoke detector (shape can changed to achieve a more
distinct-able look if unit is being patented for sale and/or etc.) If time permits a wireless data
logger can be added for easy checking of air quality at any time and perhaps even alarms to alert
supervisor of possible contamination. As well an air “filter” can be developed that can react to
whatever the sensor reads as high and filters the air until that factor reaches a stable/tolerable
level.

***Data Collection***

  Data collection will be done with the developed sensor unit and placed around
the hallways of the Brentwood Highschool and perhaps classrooms if permission is allowed, as
well in other schools to measure if PM is affected by location. Readings will be taken weekly,
after receiving the data from the unit bar graphs will be made on JMP.
